There should be about 3-5 objectives, which should be reflected in the contents page. All appendices should be referred to in the dissertation. All figures should have a caption, figure number and be referred to in the text.

The chapters normally consist of:

1.) Introduction

2.) Background (Literature review) Normally based on other peoples work so if you want credit for something, make it clear. If there's a lot you want credit for based on background reading add it under an "Analysis" section in chapter 3.

3&4.) Heart of the project

5&6.) Evaluation, Further work, Verification (does your code actually work), Validation (does your thing solve the problem) 


For reading papers do the following:

* Select papers by title
* Then filter out by abstract
* Then filter out by Introduction and Conclusion

When reading a paper, read "actively" - read the paper looking to answer a question you have. You can re read the same paper with a different question.

You should spend 4 weeks of writing the dissertation. Ask for feedback 6 weeks before submission.
