[[Lecture_5_Another_Neat_Tool|ANT]] and [[Lecture_4_Build_Systems_and_Make#Make|MAKE]] allow for different project structures, which means that it makes it hard to understand projects you are not familiar with - as they do not enforce some "best practice".

Maven is marketed as a project management tool but considered as a build tool. However, it is considered an extensible build infrastructure that implements a build life cycle over a set of standards and conventions for product structure.

Developers must follow a specific project structure when using Maven:
* A project life cycle
* Project object model
* A dependency model (external dependency)
* A set of standards
* Logic for executing plugins


Maven's builds are declarative - the elements of the project is specified but not how they are built. Maven makes use of a central repository for projects, which have a version, group and a unique artefact id. This is how external dependencies are referenced and installed locally to a project that depends on said external dependencies.

###### Project Object Model (POM)

The POM file defines a project and contains:
* The name of the project
* A set of unique identifiers
* Defines the relationships between other projects (dependencies, parents, etc)

###### Repositories

Plugins are updated via the central repository, making it easy to update infrastructure and add new build elements. Project repositories specify external dependencies, which are automatically retrieved and built.

Maven plugins consist of a collection of goals, with each goal being a unit of work, for instance compilation, test compilation etc. Each goal belongs to a lifecycle phase. A **lifecycle** is a sequence of phases involved in building a project. Each phase has a series of plugins, executing a phase executes all of the earlier phases and plugins. Phases are ran in order and dependencies are expressed in the order the phases are executed in.

Main phases include:

| Phase            | Description                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| validate         | validate the project is correct                                          |
| compile          | compile the source code of the project                                  |
| test             | test the code using unit testing framework                              |
| package          | package code into a distributed format                                  |
| integration-test | deploy the package into an environment where integrations can be tested |
| verify           | run checks to verify the package                                        |
| install          | install the package into the local repository                           |
| deploy           | copies final package to remote repository                                                                        |

Maven is a black box - it is hard to understand what is actually happening, it is hard to adapt to other project structures, conflicting dependencies can occur and are hard to resolve.
