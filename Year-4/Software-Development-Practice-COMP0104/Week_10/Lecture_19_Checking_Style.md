# Checking Style

It is good practice to keep the styling of code (how it looks) consistent throughout a code base. The guidelines for code can include:
* White-space and tab usage
* Variable, class and function naming.
* Line length
* etc...

Code bases can make use of tools that can either check for correct styling (linters) or can format code so that it can change code to follow styling guidelines.
