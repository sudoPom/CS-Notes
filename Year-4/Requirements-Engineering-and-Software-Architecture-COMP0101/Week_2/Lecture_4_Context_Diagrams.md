# Context Diagrams

A context diagram shows the set of world actors connected through interfaces. They are primarily used to define the scope of the project and to give additional context of the world the machine operates in.

###### Elements

| Concept                                         | Notation                             | Meaning                                                               |

###### Interfaces

An interface can be uni or bidirectional and contain a label and optionally content, which is the set of [[Lecture_1_Foundations#^2141e5|phenomena]] that occurs at the interface between the two actors.

The intricacies of the machine (or really any individual actor) should not be visible in a context diagram.

The model should only contain language specific to the application domain, not software engineering terminologies. The work boundary should be clearly classified.
