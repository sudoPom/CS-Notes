# Sets

A set is a group of elements:

A = {a,b,c} - This is the set of A and contains the elements "a", "b" and "c".

To say that a ∈ A means that the element "a" is inside the set A.

The ∅ set is a unique set which contains no elements.

Set A is said to be equal to set B if A is a proper subset of B and B is a proper subset of A:

A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A then A = B

A subset is just part of a larger set.

## Set Operations

A U B returns all unique elements from A and B (A or B)

A n B returns all elements present in both A and B (A and B)

A x B returns the Cartesian product of A and B. This will return a every combination of coordinates with elements from A and B, where all A elements are all the x coordinates and all B elements are y coordinates

A / B Collects all elements that are in A but removes any that are present in B (A and not B) 

A Δ B Collects everything within A and B excluding the intersection (A or B) / (A and B)

A^c Returns everything that is not in A (not A) 

## Set Algebra

The Union symbol can be taken as a + and intersection can be taken as a multiply, so the following laws apply:

***Communicative***: A U B = B U A       A n B = B n A

***Associative***: (A U (B U C)) = ((A U B) U C)   (A n (B n C)) = ()(A n B) n C)

***Distributive***: (A U (B n C)) = (A n B) U (A n C)   (A U (B n C)) = (A U B) n (A U C)

***Absorption***: (A U (A n B)) = A    (A n (A U B))

## Duality Principle 

The union of the sets A1, A2, A3.... complemented is equal to the union of all those sets, complemented 

## Set Symbols

V - Or (Union)

ʌ - And (Intersection)

¬ - Not (Negation)

∀x - For all x

∃x - There exists an x

⊕ - Exclusive or

A→B - A Implies B (If A is true B must be true)
