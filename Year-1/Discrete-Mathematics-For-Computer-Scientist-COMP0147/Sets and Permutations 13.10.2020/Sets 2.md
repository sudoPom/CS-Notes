# Sets 2

## Comparing Sets

If there exists an injective function encoding set X into set Y, we say:

| X | < = | Y | 

For example, there exists a function which maps the set of all natural numbers, N to the set Q+, rationals. As any natural number n, can be written as a fraction as n/1.

If there exists a bijective function between to sets X and Y, we say:

|X| = |Y|

The set of rational numbers, integers and natural numbers are known as countable and enumerable.
