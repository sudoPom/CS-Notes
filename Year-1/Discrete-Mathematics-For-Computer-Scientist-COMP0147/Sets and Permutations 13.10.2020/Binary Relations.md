# Binary Relations

A binary relation is a relation between two objects.

An equivalence relation, written as E(x,y) states that x = y

For equivalence relation to be valid it must be:

Reflexive: For all x,  E(x,x)

Symmetric: For all x and y, E(x,y) = E(y, x)

and Transitive: For all x,y and z, (E(x,y) ^ E(y,z)) -> E(x,z)

Generally Em(x,y) means that x - y is a multiple of m. For example E2(x-y) means the difference between x and y is even.

[k]2 = {y | E2(k,y)} This will give out all values of y, where the difference between k and y is even.

So: [0]2 = {... -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8...} Which will give out all values, lets call them x, where 0-x is even.
