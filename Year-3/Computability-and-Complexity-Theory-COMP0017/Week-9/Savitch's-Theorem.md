# Savitch's-Theorem

*Savitch's theorem* states that all the languages that can be solved non deterministically in $NSPACE(f(n))$ can also be solved in $PSPACE(f(n)^2)$, given $f(n)$ is at least linear. 

To do this we convert a NDTM $N$ into a DTM $M$ while only squaring the space used. For configurations $c$, $c'$ and $k\in\mathbb{N}$ we want to know if $N$ can get from $c$ to $c'$ in at most $k$ steps:

This is similar to [[The Ladder Game|the ladder game]] as there are a constant number of changes that can be made at any given time.

To ensure that the NDTM has only one accepting configuration we can tweak the machine by reversing the head and erasing the tape before halting.

Since the NDTM $N$ uses $f(n)$ space there are $C= |Q| \times f(n) \times |\Gamma|^{f(n)}$ different configurations.

We therefore start by calling Reachable($c_0,c_Y,C$) where $c_0$ encodes the input specific starting configuration.

Again, like in the [[The Ladder Game|ladder game]] the depth of the recursion is equal to the total number of possible configurations, $\log_2C = O(f(n))$ and each time we recurse we store a configuration which requires $O(f(n))$ space, meaning that the total space complexity is $O(f^2(n))$. 

This shows that $PSPACE = NPSPACE$.

### PSPACE Completeness and TQBF

A problem is $\text{PSPACE-complete}$ if it is in $PSPACE$ and it is $PSPACE$ hard (every problem in PSPACE is polynomially reducable to the problem).

The TQBF problem can be shown to be PSPACE complete.
