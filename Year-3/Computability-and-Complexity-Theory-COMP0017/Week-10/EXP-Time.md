# EXP-Time

EXPtime/space is defined as the time having the time/space complexity of $2^{n^d}, d\in\mathbb{N}$.

$$
\begin{align}
&P \subseteq NP \subseteq PSPACE \subseteq EXPTIME \subseteq EXPSPACE \\
&P \subsetneq EXPTIME \\
&PSPACE \subsetneq EXPSPACE
\end{align}
$$

A language is EXPTIME complete if it is EXPTIME and it is EXPTIME hard (again, every language in EXPTIME is polynomially reducible to the language)
