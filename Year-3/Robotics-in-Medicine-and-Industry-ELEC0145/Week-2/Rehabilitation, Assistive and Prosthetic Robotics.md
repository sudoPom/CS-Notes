### Strokes

There are three kinds of strokes:
* Haemorrhagic - Can happen any time and is caused by sickness and results in the weakning of the  blood vessel walls.
* Temporary Clot - Mini Stroke, does not cause permanant damage but is a signal of something being wrong.
* Ischemic - Narrowing of blood vessels, resulting in blood not being able to circulate. This prevents certain areas of the brain not retrieving blood, causing them to die (**infarction**) and causing the stroke.

Strokes can cause sensory, motor and cognitive impairments to survivors. 15 to 30% of stroke survivors are left with a long term disability.

Unilateral infarct will effect parts of the body corresponding to the side of the brain where tissue died. Infarcts can also reduce the limb strength, grip force and precision.

###### Neurorehabilitation

Neurorehabilitation is the process of re training the nervous system in order to recover - new cells are rewired to take over the role of the damaged tissue. Not all people require this as they recover spontaneously after the stroke. Three months after the stroke the rate of recovery begins to plateau. It is recommended that therapy should begin as soon as possible by a specially trained clinician. 

Neurorehabilitation is quite time consuming and requires highly specialized clinicians, doing repeated actions thousands of times a week to help the patient. This can cause work related injuries to the clinician, making it a good area for robotics.

### Neurobiology of Motor Skills Acquisition

* Early stage - The clinician does the movement for the patient. When control is redeveloped the patient will share the load with the clinician.
* Active - The action is performed against some form of resistance.

This process should be practiced for at least 15 days, initially done with a human (clinician) and will then later be done independantly with a machine.

### Rehabilitation Modalities

The use of Electromyography can be used to control prosthetic devices. Whenever an action is carried out the body part sends out electrical signals which can be monitored to produce some action.

There are 6 principles that should always encompass every theraputic program:
* The establishment of an agreement between patient and the therapy team. (patient compliance)
* Analysis of behavorial deficits according to the principles of brain reorganization.
* Reliable measuremnts of impairment, function and activity before, during and after therapy. (Need a metric to measure progress)
* Planning of a rehab program according to the prognosis of a patient.
* Administration of an appropriate amount of therapy in terms of specifity intensity and repetitiveness.
* The presence of an appropriate therapeutic environment (space)  
shaped for motor learning

###### Motor Rehab Techniques:
* Priming Techniques - 
	* Action observation Patient may not be aware they are not  performing an action correctly and will need to be told.
	* Mirror therapy: The injured limb is hidden behind a mirror so that the patient can only see the healthy limb moving. Reflection in the mirror helps retraining the injured limb
* Augmenting techniques - 
* Task specific practice -
