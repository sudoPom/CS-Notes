# Design Principles

## Separation of concerns

Splitting a computer program into sections so that each section addresses a separate concern. For example the Internet Protocol is split into four abstraction layers: Application, Transport, Internet and Link. 

## Abstraction 

Hide all data that is not relevant about an object to reduce complexity.
