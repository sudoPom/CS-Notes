## Agile Methodologies

Agile methodologies are iterative - work is done on iterations and each step (Plan Design Develop Test Release and Feedback) are small scale rather than large when it comes to the Waterfall method.

* Customer Satisfaction through frequent delivery

* Changing requirements

* Deliver frequently

* Cooperation between business people and developers

  With Agile development all processes go in parallel and complement each other.

### Extreme Programming:

User story: Allows a customer to state their requirements for software. Normally in the form of a flashcard. Contains a title, what is required and why, the importance, estimation of completion date and acceptance criteria

Stand-up Meeting: A daily meeting where the team stands in a circle and take turns discussing problems, solutions, plans for tasks for the day and previously completed tasks.

### Scrum

Focus on 'sprints' which last for 1-2 weeks. There are three roles, product owner, scrum master and scrum team.

* Product Owner: Motivate the team with the goal, communicates with stakeholders and the scrum team
* Scrum Master: Ensures the team follows the scrum process, sets up meetings etc.
* Scrum Team: A group that works together in seperate roles to complete tasks on the sprint backlog
