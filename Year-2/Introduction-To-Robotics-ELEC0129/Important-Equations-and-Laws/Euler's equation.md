# Euler's Equation
Euler's equation states that for a rigid body rotating with angular velocity $w$ and angular acceleration $\dot{w}$, the moment $N$ acting on the rigid body must be given by/;

$$
\begin{align}
N = ^cI\dot{w}+w\times ^cIw
\end{align}
$$

This is very similar to [[Newtons-Second-Law|Newtons second law]] if you consider the inertial tensor $^cI$ as the mass but for rotary motion.
