# Matricies Continued

Every linear map can be represented as a matrix. The columns of the matrix representing some linear transformation, represents the images of the basis.

If the columns in a matrix are not linearly independant, then the linear map that the matrix represents does not have an inverse and neither dies the matrix. For matricies that have an inverse, the kernel of the matrix must be the zero vector.
