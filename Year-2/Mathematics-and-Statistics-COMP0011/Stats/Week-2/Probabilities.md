# Probability

The probabililty of an action occuring is a numerical value from 0-1 which dictates how likely that action is to occur.

## Definitions



* A `random experiment` is any action with an uncertain outcome. 

* The `Sample space` $\Omega$ is the set of all possible outcomes or sample points.

* An `event` is a subset of the sample space, normally sharing some kind of common property.

For an event $E$, $E^c$ means that the event $E$ does not occur.

The probability of an event happening is equal to the sum of the probabilities of its sample ponts. 

* $P(E) \geq 0 $
* $P(E) \leq 1 $
* $P(\Omega) = 1$
* $P(\empty) = 0$
