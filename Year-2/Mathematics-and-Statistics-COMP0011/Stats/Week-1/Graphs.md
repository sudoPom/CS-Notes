# Graphs

Graphs can be used to represent quantitative data.

`Bar graphs` can be used to represent discrete quantitative data. The horizontal axis represents the different values each variable can take. Above these values a bar can be drawn with the height of the bar being the frequency of variables who have that value. `Relative bar graphs` are the same as usual bar graphs but the heights of the bars are scaled down by doing $frequency/total \ frequency$.

`Histograms` can be used to represent continuous data. The horizontal axis represents the range of possible values and the height represents frequency per x value. Where x can be number. The area of each box is proportional to the frequency unlike how the height of the bar is proportional to the frequency in bar graphs. Relative frequencies can also be used with histograms, which is really useful when working with large data sets with varying values.
