# Terminology and Data Types

Some terminology used:

* A `random experiment` is any action with an unexpected outcome, like a coin toss.

* `Population` All possible replications of the experiment.

* `Sample` A subset of the population.

  Samples should have accurately reflect the population.

* `Variable` A quantity or characteristic of interest for any member of the population.
* `Data` the set of values of one or more variables recorded for a sample from the population.

## Data Types

There are two types of data, quantitative and qualitative,

* `Quantative` data is a numeric value measuring some quantative quality.
  * `Discrete Quantative` data means the set of possible values is countable (same size as natural numbers)
  * `Continuous Quantative` data means the set of possible values is uncountable, the values can (but don't have to) be within a ceratain range.
* `Qualitative` data is based on categories based on some qualitative quality.
  * `Binary` data can only take two possible values
