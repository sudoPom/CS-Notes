## Question 1

A confidentiality requirement should be that students should not be able to access other student's data with their own SN. 

An integrity agreement should be that all information stored about a given student should be correct and safely stored on a secure database.

Lastly, an availability agreement should be that students should be able to access their own data. This depends on the system but system administrators should also be able to access all student's data.
