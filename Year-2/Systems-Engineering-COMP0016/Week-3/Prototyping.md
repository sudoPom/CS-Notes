# Prototyping

A prototype is a representation that emphasises something in your design and de-emphasises other things. They can be physical, digital or drawn. Prototypes allow stakeholders to interact with it and explore it's usability. 

Prototypes don't have to have super high fidelity, they just need to have interactability.

Balsamic is a tool that can be used to design interactable wireframe prototypes. Wireframes should only be concerned with the information and the structure of the product.
