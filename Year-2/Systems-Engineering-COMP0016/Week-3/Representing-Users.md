# Representing Users

Requirements:

* Who is the target user
* What are the defining characteristics
* How can we represent said users

Personas and Scenarios are used to abstract from the details. Personas abstract from the type of user whilst Scenarios abstract from the context of where the product is being used.

## Persona

A ficticious character who represents a type of user, based on research. Personas help determine the users needs when it comes to the user. We can only collect data from other classmates.

They should have:

* A name
* Characteristics
* Goals
* A personal background

Example: (We have this template on moodle)

Personas should not be made up, they should be based off data (in our case they will probably be made up). They prevent making decisions based on your own experiences.

## Scenario

A scenario is a story/situation of which the product being designed is used. It also involves the sequences of events using the product and their resulting actions.

A scenario should be:

*  Simple
* Natural 
* Personal

Scenarios help give context to the use of the product. It will also reveal the needs, goals and user requirements. A scenario should be based on a single persona achieving a user goal. Scenarios should represent, at the very least, the majority of personas not the exceptions.
