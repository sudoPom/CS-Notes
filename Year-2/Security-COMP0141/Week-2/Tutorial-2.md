## Question 1
$(a)$  I would choose the app that requires the smallest amount of permissions. Least Privilege
$(b)$  Do not give the code for the building to the person, entrust it to someone else. Same thing with the code of the room. Separation of responsabilities
$(c)$  Do not give permanent access. Complete Mediation
$(d)$  Drink something you know won't get you hammered. Fail-safe default
$(e)$  Set up a variety of security measures to protect my website from a large variety of attacks. Defense in Depth
$(f)$ Make the algorithm used public, yet keep how to break it a secret. Open Design
$(g)$ Give the reason as to why the login failed. Psychological accessability.
$(h)$  No, the systems put in place should be easy for the clients to understand as well as easy/cheap to implement. Economics of mechanisms
$(i)$ A secure, isolated environment. Prudent paranoia
$(j)$ Only collect the data we need, required for analysis, delete the data when it is no longer needed. Privacy Promotion
$(k)$ The else statement should represent the user not being allowed access: Failsafe Default
```java
DWORD dwRet = IsAccessAllowed(...);
if (dwRet == ACCESS_GRANTED){
	//allow access
}
else{
	//don't allow access
}
```

## Question 2
Releasing the design of the software conforms withe the opend design prinicple, however this is to an extent since more information (like the source code) is not being made available to the public.
