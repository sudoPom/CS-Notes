# Security Behaviour

Security problems are caused by attacks which can be:
* online (gaining unauthorised access to a file)
* digital (maliciously tampering with the contents of a file) 
* physical (theft of physical assets).

Companies put up policies and mechanisms to minimise the risk of attacks. `User facing` policies involve humans, and should be obvious and easy for employees within the company to follow.

`COM-B`: A system proposed by Michie et al - what reasons or what change will need to occur in order to change security measures. These include Capabilities, Opportunity and Motivation.

## Security Policies
A `security policy` is a set of a mechanisms which employees must follow in order to keep the data and devices of the organisations secure

Policies and mechanisms fail due to:
* Unintentional failiures
	* Human error - mistakes
	* Non compliance - It is inefficient to follow the policies when trying to do your job well.
* Malicious activities (Insider attacks)

People tend to ignore / fail to adhere to policies as they can:
* Be too complex
* Interfere with user tasks and business processes
* Make it hard to do their jobs

Which will cause employees to cut corners.

Employees may also fail to adhere to policies due to a lack of awareness of the importance of security or they lack the knowledge.

### Cost
Organisations must determine the effectiveness of security in preventing attacks and the value security has to the business. The `ISO27001  standard` states that organisations should "establish, implement, maintain and continually improve" information security management, and "prevent or reduce undesired effects". 

Security is a secondary task, it is not required to complete an activity but a process which makes resources safe and secure to attackers. It should not impact the primary processes of a business. It should ideally add value to a process rather than just being there for risk mitigation.

Following security mechanisms costs employees time, which in turn costs the organisation money.

#### Time
Employees are not always super motivated by security, as it often can be seen to get in the way of the employees task - which in turn costs the company money.
