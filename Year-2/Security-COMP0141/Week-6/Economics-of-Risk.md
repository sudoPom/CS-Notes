# Economics of Risk
`Risk Analysis` aims to:
* Identify assets and their importance
* Identify threats and their likelihood
* Asses the proximity (Temporal or physical) of known threats
* Identify vulnerabilities and the likelihood of them being exploited

When it comes to risk analysis, the main problem is that we do not know all the threats and vulnerabliities. A `Risk register` returns a list of:
* Risk type and severity
* Owner of risks (who is effected)
* Possible courses of actions, to anticipate known threats prior to an incident and how to respond to an incident.
* Residual risk

## Responses to risks
Risks can be:
* Avoided - Withdraw completely from the activity that causes the risk
* Acceptance - Do nothing
* Minimisation - Use security measures to reduce the risk
* Reaction/Recovery 

Countermeasures that reduce risks can actually bring in more unintended risks, which can cause unintended harms.

There are four types of risks:
* Known knowns - risks that everyone is aware about
* Known unknowns: Only experts are aware of these risks
* Unknown knowns: Risks that are not involved in the risk assessment
* Unknown unknowns: Risks that nobody knows about until they are realised.

## Individual Risk Perception
Different people have different perceptions of risk and will therefore respond differently to risks.

John Adams states that there are three types of risks:
* Perceived through science
More rational factor. Published literature on risk management falls into this category.
* Experienced directly
Dealt with through judgement, a combination of instinct and experience. Almost entirely dependant on our sensory capabilities. We percieve a fire differently to how we percieve a bacteria.
* Virtual risks.
When the science is inconclusive, judgement is again used. Usually culturally constructed from pre established beliefs, convictions, prejudices and superstitions.

`Risk conmpensation` suggests that introducing a safety measure may change behaviour. For example, people who wear seatbelts are safer, so are more likely to take risks while driving.

### Bad risk assessment
People can be bad at assessing risks due to 
* Incorrectly assessing probabilities
* Over/under estimating threats that have affected people they know
* Easily recalled/vivid events can increase risk perception.

## Risk and Uncertainty
`Known risk`: Probabilities that can be measure empirically.
`Uncertainites`: Cannot be measured empirically as risks are unknown.
Most risks are a mixture of both known risks and uncertainties.

A small risk containing some uncertainty leads to the perception of the risk being non exsistent.

### Risk Communication
Communication of risks influences the response to the risk. People may downplay the outcomes by using words like "maybe" or "Likely"

## Security Theatre
A `security theatre` aims to increase the perception of security while not neccassarily increasing security. For example, banks are usually large sophisticated buildings, giving off the impression of a safe place, however most banks do not have a large amount of security, especially against armed attackers.
