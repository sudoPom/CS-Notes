# Economics of Security
More security measures means that employees will find it difficult to be productive, creating conflict between workforces and security managment.

`Economics of Security` deals with limited resource situations.

Tasks may have differing individual and organisational costs. This can cause `risk dumping` which is the process of shifting risks to others who may not have agreed to it and/or may not be prepared for it.

## Costs and Benefits of Security
* Individual costs (Physical and cognitive workload, temporal burden, reduced productivity)
* Organisational Costs (Interference with production and investment in technologies)
* Individual Benefits (Avoiding sanctions)
* Organisational benefits (Demonstratable compliance, good reputation, good productivity) 

Security measures and inventions should be selected based on:
* The nature of the threat
* The costs of implementation
It the minimal level of protection cannot be reached the no defence is the right option as it is more expensive to implement something that wont work in the first place.

`Scarcity` affects what people notice, how they weigh their choices, how we deliberate and what we decide and how we behave".

A person may choose to cut corners if:
* They are under pressure
* They are unsure if they have the ability to carry out the task

Employees need incentives to behave as the organisation wants (eg following a security policy).

`Utility` is the amount of satisfaction a person gains from consuming a good.
People don't have enough time or resources to make the most rational decisions, so we use hueristics to make decisions such as:
* `loss aversion` - People tend to make decisions to avoid losses rather than to gain something.
* `Availability` - Perceptions are biased based on how quickly we can find examples 

Influencers may assume that employees will follow all security policies no matter how time consuming, which is a false assumption due to the fact that employees are already busy doing their tasks, and will therefore find workarounds for bad security.

## Economics of Individual Security Decisions

`The compliance budget` explains how employees make compliance decisions, focused on the perception of costs and benefits of complying to a security policy. Compliance budgets can assist managers improve their security policies. It shows that if the percieved employee cost is higher than the benefit of complying to the policy then employee will not follow the policy as it seems rational.

Investing in things other than security can improve security:
* Environmental investments (like changes to the workspace) can make users less stressed, resulting in fewer errors
* Teaching people how to act in a more secure manner will help them make fewer decisions which cause security vulnerabilities.
