# Human Performance
To support human performance we should:
* Make workload manageable
* Support necessary knowledge and skills
* Encourage confidence and motivatition

We should also avoid causing the following with a security measure:
* Stress
* Fatigue 
* Disatisfaction

Security mechanisms should be designed to fit the users, the taks the user is trying to carry out, the technology platform being used and the social/physical context. These should apply with context to the primary task being completed by the user. If it causes friction with a primary task users will see the security measures as an obstacle.


Security measures should be put in place which align with user capabilities and limitations. It is not constructive to state that the users are "stupid" if they cannot follow a security policy.

## Physical and Scoial Context
Context can effect how well a task can be carried out.

Physical Context includes:
* Atmosphere
* Cimate
* Lighting
* Noise
* Surroundings (Eavesdroppers)
* Physical proximity to risks (people are more likely to be aware of dangers closer to them)

Social Context Includes:
* Social norms:
	* Politeness
	* Helpfulness
	* Trust

If a policy violates these social norms, people are les likely to follow them.
* Social values (Something that is good and worthwile, worth having and striving for)
* Social norms - Behavorial embodiement of values. If being polite is a social value a social norm would be saying please and thank you.

Security that follow social values and norms are more likely to be followed. These should be researched prior to implementation.

### Temporal context
Security should also fit into temporal constraints of a business. Employees have limited time to carry out their jobs, so anything that eats out of their time costs the company money.

## Characteristics
Characteristics can be split into two types, specific and general. When designing mechanisms as many of these characteristics should be considered for.

#### General Characteristics 
* Physical
	* Human body: Finger size, dexterity
	* Perceptual system: Ability to detect signals
* Mental: 
	* Memory processing
	* Existing knowledge and skills, attitudes
	
## Workload

Workload can be physical or cognitive. For productivity workload associated with completing a task should be track to ensure that it is viable for a human to carry out. (Remembering a 30 character password is usually not feasible).

Generally, extra mental work load is worse than physical work load.

A `workload audit` contains information on:
* The workload associated with primary and secondary tasks
* Are there performance constraints on the primary task.
* Where does the security  interrupt with the primary task?
* What is the consequences of an interruption in the primary task due to a secondary task?

Primary tasks are seen as what employees are getting paid to do and where their expertise/skills matter. While secondary tasks can be seen as obstacles/distractions, tasks with some benefit but a larger cost or useful tasks that confer some personal gain (like locking a door to feel safer in the workplace).

From the organisations view, a primary task is what individuals are hired to carry out with their expertise. Anything that reduces human performance will reduce the performance of the organisation - causing excessive workload and stress. If a task exceeds human capability the employees are expected to just work harder. Which is not sustainable in the long term.s

Friction between two tasks means that they are a bad fit and come come from:
* Excessive workload - one or more tasks exceed the capabilities of the user to carry put those tasks.
* Conflict between processes + resource demands (which task should be carried out and which should be ignored).

Some policies can also conflict with other policies due to the assumption that they are working in isolation, which is not the case, this can also cause some policies to work less well as users probably will not be able to spend all their time adhering to one policy when there are many.
Failures happen when policies exceed available resources, meaning some or all of the tasks are not completed.
