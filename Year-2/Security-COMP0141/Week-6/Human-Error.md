# Human Error
`Human error` is defined as "the failure of planned actions to achieve their desired ends - without the intervention of some unforeseeable event".

Systems must be designed: 
* Without conditions that induce errors
* To nticipate human errors and provide fail safes
* To recover rapidly in case of any incidents

 `Reason's Swiss Cheese model` models defences/barriers/safeguards provided by rules, procedures and security measures as slices as cheese, where each slice of cheese has holes, representing the vulnerablility in the defence. These holes are known as:
 * Latent Failures: Organisation and workplace conditions.
 * Active failures: Errors and violations.

###### Cognitive resources and error
People have a concious workspace and automatic behaviours. These should work smoothly together in order for good performance, but can compete for command of cognitive resources which can result in unintended actions that can induce human error in the workspace.

## Types of Errors

There are three types of errors:
* Mistakes: Goal is not reached due to a lack of a plan
* Lapse: Planning has been carried out but a step in the plan was not carried out.
* Slip: Failure to be able to carry out a step in a plan.

Most (90%) actions are skill based meaning:
* They can be done automatically
* Utilise conscious goal setting with automatic control
* Makes use of habbits, reducing the cognitive load required to perform tasks.
* Causes absent mindedness

About 10% of actions are knowledged based. They are:
* Slow
* Require full attention
* Error prone
* Flexible

## Causes of Errors

Factors that trigger errors include:
#### Individual Factors
* New taks
* Lack of skills/knowldge
* Inexperience
#### Human Factors
* Habits
* Assumptions
* Memory limitations
#### Task Demands
* Time pressureChange in routine
* Poor equipment
* Interruptions

* High workload
* Unclear rules
#### Work Environment Factors:
* Change in routine
* Poor equipment
* Interruptions

Some people intentionally violate policies, (without intention of negative consequences) Which can be caused by beliefs such as Illusions of:
* Control
* Invulnerablility
* Superioority
* Futility

If defences are not put in place to prevent these errors and violations will cause a hazard.
## Measuring Performance and Error
Security goals should be driven by the business requirements, human capabilities should be acknowledged and supported and different secondary tasks should not compete with each other and they should not get in the way of primary tasks.

Workload and performance can be measured either analytically or empirically:
* Analytic measurements estimates time and complexity based on simple user actions such key strokes. 
* Empirical measurements use subjective measures that are applied after completing a task.

Factors to assess include:
* `Prospective workload`: "How long do you think it will take to carry out a task?"
* `Retrospective workload`: "How long do you think it took you to finish the task?"

Time elapsed can be measured while also specifying the type of effort (cognitive or physical).
