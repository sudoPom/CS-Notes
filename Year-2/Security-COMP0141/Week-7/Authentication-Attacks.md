# Authentication Attacks
 `Phishing` is an attack which involves emailing someone pretending to be some authoratative figure in attempt to steal the victims details. There are also attacks like vishing (phishing over voice), smishing (over SMS) and `pharming` is a technique to enhance phishing.

 `Spear Phishing` is a type of phishing where the attacker is more specific in their scheme to seem more convincing, which provides a higher success rate for the attacks.

 Some teams in companies known as `red teams` test employees with "fake phishing" emails in order to try and see whether they are knowledgable on phishing attacks.

 `Phishing websites` use similar domain names to trusted ones in order to trick users to willingly enter sensitive information, thinking they are doing so on the official website.

 `Typosquatting` also use similar domains (that users may misstype) that have typos in them, which will lead users to a website that looks like the official website but will again get users to enter their sensitive information.

### Attacks on what you know
* Skimming
* Keylogging
* Packet Sniffing (on unencrypted web traffic)
* Intimate partner violence (an attack from someone close to you that you trust)
* Observation attacks (shoulder surfing)
* Side channel attacks (finger grease, keyboard emanations)
* Coercion attacks (torture babyy)

### Attacks on what you have
* `Replay attacks` - listening in on authentication messages and resending them to authenticate as the victim. Easily avoided by making authentication challenges time based or random. 
* Verification Scams - recieving information needed by attacker by impersonating an authorotative figure (company).

Password managers allow people to have many passwords that they do not need to remember multiple different passwords or use the same password for multiple different accounts. They have issues such as using accounts on different devices require users to set up the password manager which is time consuming.
