# Tutorial 1

## Question 1

A Student should not be able to access another student's data using their own SN. (High degree of importance)

A Student's information should be correct, kept up to date, and stored securely so it cannot be tampered with or stolen. (High degree of importance)

A Student should only be able to access their data with their own SN and a system administrator should be able to access/edit a student's data.



## Question 2

a.) Confidentiality

b.) Confidentiality

c.) Integrity

d.) Availability

e.) Confidentiality

f.) Confidentiality

g.) Integrity

h.) Integrity

i.) Confidentiality

j.) Availability

k.) Confidentiality

l.) Confidentiality

## Question 3

a.) Threat, thieves will be able to enter the bank to steal items as a result of some vulnerability in the bank, making it a threat.

b.) Impact, this is the result of an attack being carried out.

c.) Vulnerability, weak passwords can cause attacks.

d.) Vulnerability, loss of a back up system can cause data loss.

e.) Threat, hackers being able to install malware is a result of a system vulnerability.

f.) Impact, this is a result of some kind of attack causing system failure.

g.) Vulnerability, This bias/error can be abused by attackers.

h.) Vulnerability, Without checking identity, this allows an adversary to pretend to be you and steal your room.

## Question 4

a.) Not a security problem, physical obstacles may cause problems in sending a signal (maybe even data loss) but this is not a targeted attack by anyone.

b.) This is a security threat as leaving a valuable laptop in a car leaves it vulnerable to being stolen. The threat level can be reduced by locking the car, and keeping the laptop out of view.

c.) Not a security issue, there is no threat by a human or man made object to cause loss//theft/alteration of data.

d.) This is a security problem as the exam is open to anyone on the internet, even those who should not have access to it.

e.) This is a security threat as it leaves what could be a conversation that contains private information prone to eavesdropping.

f.) This is a security problem as it prevents the server from working as intended by people who may need it.

g.) This is a security problem as this leave data stored elsewhere (SSD) vulnerable to being stolen without the need of decryption.

h.) This is a security problem as any data sent across the network could be intercepted easily by a hacker.

i.) This is not necessarily a security risk so long as border control do not check through your devices, which they are not entitled to (and therefore shouldn't be modeled to be able to do under a threat model).

j.) This is a security risk as the installed software could be malware that could cause damage to the system it is installed on when ran.

k.) This is a security risk as the country could force manufacturers to add devices that send data from the hardware/software to the country in hopes of gaining sensitive information from the country.

l.) This is a security risk as someone could have taken the phone, tampered with it or stolen some information, then placed it back in a visible place for you to find it again.

m.) This is a security risk as someone could use the image of your face plus some software to access any of your information locked behind facial recognition.

## Question 5

### Threats (What could go wrong)

* The students could access things they shouldn't have access to such as explicit content or things disruptive to learning etc. This is very likely as students have previously done this and is therefore not a hard task to do, furthermore there is the posibility of students sharing their techniques of bypassing blocks online.
* The district could lose the ability to track the students details. This is very likely as students in the past have found a way to disable/bypass tracking of the ipad.
* Tracking of the iPads could be misused by distric employees. This is not likely as district officials tend to have the student's wellbeing in mind.
* Apple could track the users to see where they visit. This is likely as this could information could be sold to other companies by Apple for increased revenue.

### Vulnerabilities (System weaknesses)

* Easy to bypasss/disable tracking features.
* Easily bypassable software blocks.
* District and Apple has access to students location at all times they have the iPad.
