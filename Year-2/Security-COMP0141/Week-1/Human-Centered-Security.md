# Human-Centered Security

Security mainly concerns humans and should therefore be centered around them.

Security is not a primary task, as doing anything with any device essentially exposes us to attacks, using systems to complete a task is the primary goal whilst security is secondary.

There should be a good balance between usability and security to ensure people can ensure safely perform tasks.

## Usability 

`Usability` is defined as "a measure of how well a specific user in a specific context can use a product/design to achieve a defined goal effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily".
Systems should be usable for a user with a specific goal. Users may have different goals since users tend to be different.

Security policies can:

* Be too complex.
* Provide the temptation to cut corners.
* Fail to make it clear what the real threats and risks are.
* Interfere with the users goals.

Usability can be evaluated by data collection, user studies and walk-throughs by usability experts.

### Improvements

Users lack intuition about complex computing devices $\to$ Provide security education training.

Users are in charge of their own (complex) devices $\to$ Make security invisible

It is hard to estimate risks $\to$ Help users build more accurate user models

Security measures feel like they get in the way $\to$ Make security the path of least resistance

## Unintentional Failures

Security issues can happen due to unintentional failures:
* Human Error
* Non Compliance

These can occur due to:
* Users lack intuition about complex computing devices.
* Users are in charge of their own (complex) devices.
* It is hard to estimate risks.
* Security measures feel like they get in the way.

Security designers may (falsely) assume that users:
* Can devote time and effort to security related tasks.
* Are motivated by security.
* Need more knowledge or training in order to comply if they are not doing so already.
